# INSE6220 Final Project Energy Efficiency Project Classification with PyCaret

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python, to classify energy efficiency metrics based on input features. It is designed to streamline the process of building machine learning models, from data preparation to deployment.

## Features

Utilizes PyCaret for model setup, training, and evaluation.

Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights into energy efficiency datasets.

Demonstrates feature engineering and selection techniques.

Provides end-to-end workflow: data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.
